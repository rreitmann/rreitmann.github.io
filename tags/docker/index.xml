      <description>As a backend developer in the team &amp;ldquo;Digital Distribution&amp;rdquo; of the Magicline I was part of a 6-member international and cross-functional team which was responsible for making the Magicline available to end customers both on a test basis and in the further process for a fee. The goal was to automate the process as much as possible and to simplify the familiarization with the Magicline so that the end customers can start using the Magicline on their own.</description>
